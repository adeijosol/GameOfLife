## Controls
- `p` Pause/resume the simulation
- `c` Clear the grid
- `r` Randomise the grid
- `f` Draw filled cells / cell outlines
- `q` Quit

## Notes
The simulation:
- is initially paused.
- starts with a random seed.
- draws filled cells by default.

When there are many live cells, flashes of random background colours occasionally occur. The cause is unknown.
